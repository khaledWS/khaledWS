- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Khaled i am a 24 year old Male from Palestine who is very intrigued by the digital world enough to spend a lot of money to study about it in university ðŸ˜…
- During university i was interested in software the most and after a lot of contemplating i decided its Web development that i want to get into but in this modern 
age the amount of options and different programming languages and frameworks is very overwhelming for a beginner and it actually demotivated me from making progress 
for a good while until an upperclassmen that i look up to gave me an advice, he told me "Khaled it doesn't matter what you learn now Changing programming languages 
and even fields in software development is easier than you think Just go with one and once you do you will gain perspective to decide what you really want to do" very
good advice from a great person, this person is only one year older than me but he already holds a respectable position in a successful company so i followed his advice
And went with **PHP/LARAVEL** and as he said everyday i'm learning new things and gaining more perspective.
- i have not been evaluated by professionals but i think i am at the level where i would be called **a junior Laravel Developer**, in a city where the unemployment exceeds
40% its very difficult to get an internship let alone a job so i had a lot of difficulties but i managed to get an internship at the Ministry of Health but getting a local
job is going to be difficult so my aim for now would be Working online as a freelancer or for a foreign company.
- My immediate goal is to start earning income, my long term goal as everyone is to be successful you never know what happens but i am going to try my hardest to achieve that
Goal, although in the field of software specifically right now i'm interested in Software engineering 
- Hobbies? during and the pandemic i got into Anime and realized i very much like anime and ended up watching a lot i also very recently found out that found out that i am intrigued
by philosophy so in the near future i'll be reading books on that
